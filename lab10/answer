1. A. 	we are not stopping the IntStream.generate(() -> 1), 
		so whenever the forEach loop asks the IntStreamit for the next element in the pipeline 
		the generator generates one and added to the stream, although the distinct() method don't 
		allow only one type to go through the pipeline to the consumer. 
		So we need to stop the generator at some point.
		we can fix this by put a limit on it this way 
		***IntStream ones = IntStream.generate(() -> 1).limit(20).distinct();***
		
	B. 	System.out.println(stringStream.collect(Collectors.joining(",")));
